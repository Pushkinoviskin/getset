## Project Idea

![](http://sigite2012.sigite.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BikingInCalgary.jpg)

A bike trail finding app for the Calgary area. The app will allow users to access and search a database of current biking trails in the Calgary area. Users can also add, delete, or edit their trails, as well as rate and comment on other people's trails. A trail in the database would consist of a map view of the trail, a description, the rating, difficulty level, length, pictures, and comments. The application will be designed to be used by anyone who likes or wants to try biking, from the casual to the experienced. The methods that users will use the app are when they are trying to find new trails to try out in and around the city, when they want to save and/or share their favorite trails, and it also gives them an avenue by which to put their recommendation out there to fellow enthusiasts. 


## Stakeholders and Users

![](http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/calgary/cms/binary/9940455.jpg?size=640x420)

Users: 
1. Professional cyclists: are athletes, who cycle for a living; have a lot of experience and training with a background in regularly participating in cycling events.
 
2. Law enforcement cyclists: are police officers who monitor all over the city on bicycles; have a lot of experience and training with a background in law enforcement.
 
3.  Commuter cyclists: are local residents of the city of Calgary, whose primary means of transportation is a bicycle to commute to and from work, school, etc. 
 
4. Prospective cyclists: can be local or even non-local residents of the city, such as hobbyists or tourists, who don’t regularly cycle, but who occasionally enjoy cycling as a pastime activity and have some training.
 
Stakeholders: This includes all the users mentioned above plus 
 
1. Pedestrians:  involve anyone in the vicinity of the bike trails, who are on foot, and could potentially be affected by the users of the system. They can even decide to use the system, although it is assumed that they have little to no experience.
 
2. Dog walkers: involve anyone in the vicinity of the bike trails, who are on foot and walking their dogs, who could potentially be affected by the users of the system. They can even decide to use the system, although it is assumed that they have little to no experience.
 
3. City of Calgary: the city’s parks and recreation center, who manage such locations around the city. 


## User Research Methods

![](http://i.imgur.com/lp61oPu.jpg)

User research was conducted using 3 main methods, Secondary Research, Interviews, and Character Profiles. Secondary research was chosen since it reflected what a typical user would experience and what they were looking for in a service similar to ours. Interviews were chosen since they are able to give a specific insight into someone who currently is dealing with the problem and what they would be looking for in our services/solution to the problem. Character profiles were chosen to reflect someone who would use our service and be able to get more specific insight into the types of people who would use our service. 

### User Research Method 1: 

![](http://i.imgur.com/DAfTcIn.png)

The first research method is the Secondary Research method. This was selected because it allows us to view current tools that are similar to ours, and also because it will give us insight into what people are looking for / are in the current methods that are in use. With the new knowledge it will help to determine the design and needs for our app. 
 
The first step taken was to do a quick google search for bike trails in Calgary, this was done to see of there are websites or apps that provide a similar service to ours. This search gave us many different web pages that mainly outlined the routes for bikers in the city. 
One such website: http://www.avenuecalgary.com/July-2012/Get-Outside-6-Beautiful-Places-to-Ride-Your-Bike-in-Calgary/ outlines a few paths that may be interesting, and although it is a good post, it is dated and the paths are not detailed enough. 
The other websites gave a citywide overview of the legal paths for bikes, which one could use to create their own trail, but this doesn’t have the rating or relevant info that our app would provide. 
One of the websites, which is also part of an app: http://www.mapmyride.com/ca/calgary-alberta/ does provide a similar service as our app, but some of the routes look outdated and it doesn’t contain the sharing/social database that our app provides. 
With some further research from the app reviews, it seems that most people are happy with the idea of tracking on a map and its interface, but are disappointed in some of the bugs that the app still has. 
 
Another app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android.roadbike.lite is even more similar to our app and does provide most of the services that our app aims to provide and in a similar fashion. 
 
Some of the more interesting findings is that most of the people using these apps are people who want to mainly bike for fitness and exercise, rather than just for leisure or finding new routes. This could be linked to the fact that the databases do not allow for a more “social” form of trail sharing (pictures, reviews, ratings, etc.), which means that our app may be able to reach out to more people and it may have a more diverse set of users. 
 
Overall, the research method has provided us with the knowledge that people are definitely looking for an app that has bike trails, and one that does provide tracking and sharing the trails, as well as specific tracking for exercising. 


### User Research Method 2:
The second research method we will be using is Character Profiles, to get an in depth look at the most likely demographic that will be using our tool, collecting as much salient information with regards to a biking app as possible. This information will be vital in designing key features of the app, to keep them relevant to the users needs and interests, and its the most realistic way we have beside interviewing to gather information about user habits and behaviours with this style of tool.
 
The Character Profiles were accomplished by asking a wide variety of acquaintances and friends who we know are into biking in an spectrum of levels of involvement and experience. The profiles were built with an in depth interview and conversation about their desires concerning bicycling, fitness and current habits with their phone and applications they find easy and enjoyable to use.

This research method has been very useful in determining what pitfalls to avoid while designing our application, and what things users are looking to be able to find out with a tool such as ours, as well getting an in depth picture of what specific users of our app might look like in regards to their hobbies and level of involvement in similar applications to ours. 

### User Research Method 3:
Conducting interviews is the third method we’ve chosen to employ for our research. This method is appropriate for the context of creating the bike trail app since it involves direct communication with potential users. Moreover, it complements the character profiles we’ve gathered as a second research method. The interviewees mostly included bikers, who could potentially use the app. The interviewees were selected at random from multiple locations within the city, such as parks and on campus at the University of Calgary. It provided insight into the varied preferences of bikers, such as the diverse ways bikers currently navigate around the city, the reasons they choose to bike, locations around the city where they normally bike, any difficulties they may face as bikers, and features/tools they would like to be made available to make their ride easy, safe, and more enjoyable.
 
We conducted two interviews on campus, and two interviews in the park: The questions were as follows:
- How often do you ride your bike?
- What are your reasons for biking? (commute, leisure, etc…)
- Where do you normally like to bike around the city?
- What are some problems you face while biking around the city?
- What methods do you currently use to discover new bike trails?
- Would you be willing to use technology (phone app) for assistance in locating or creating bike trails?
- Would you be excited about sharing your bike trails with others?
 
We received varied answers from each of these potential users, but their problems and/or needs were common. The bikers rode their bikes on a daily basis, about 4-5 times a week. The 1st biker’s reason for biking was simply and only for commuting and had no interest in riding his bike for leisure or other purposes, whereas the 2nd biker enjoys biking for every occasion. The main problem for both bikers was the lack of enough bike lanes around the city, and how they could use a dedicated path to aid them in their ride. In addition, the 1st biker had no interest in using any kind of technology or sharing any trails he may come across, but believes that such technology could be useful tool for other bikers; the 2nd biker on the other hand was quite enthusiastic about the idea.
 
In the park, the inteviewees were older than the students surveyed on campus. The first individual interviewed was a commuter cyclist for several years until lately, and took weekly trips out to bragg creek and Millarville. He noted that an application to discover new trails would be useful to him, especially when dealing with routes that are not currently signed out by Parks Calgary, such as trips into urban areas where directions could get tricky. He had a group of friends with which he would discover trails with, and he thought that being able to share and review trails he had taken would be a useful feature. 
The second man interviewed did not bike as much as he wanted to, only getting out every year or so for a few trips around the community. He said that he biked in parks and around the greenbelts and walkways around his neighborhood mostly, with his dog. His bike is set up with a smartphone mount for the purpose of GPS, so he was enthusiastic about the prospect of an app to help specifically with biking. The manner in which he discovered new trails was simply by following his wife, and when asked about the ability to share and review bike trails he stated that it would be very cool to be able to do. 


### Reflections on User Research
The methods we used to research and gather information about the potential design of our application, and the needs and habits of our users, were effective in bringing to light certain aspects and features of a biking trail app that we would not have been able to identify without the insight of varied user Interviews, current tool Secondary Research, or in depth Character Profiles, such as the interest of certain bikers on the dog-friendly nature of certain bike paths, or the apparent data supporting a larger percentage of fitness-focused users over casual users, or the estimated social media side involvement of the average user within our biking trail app.

The research methods we conducted, especially with the interviews and character profiles, were hampered by one very obvious flaw, however, and that is time. While getting outside insight was useful, until we have many more opinions, we can't say with total confidence that the information we gathered was a true honest reflection of the average needs and habits of bikers around the city. WIth more time, this could be rectified, by interviewing a larger, more diverse, section of our potential users. Another flaw, concerning Secondary Research, was the outdated information of some of these sources that are a few years old. A more exhaustive search could remedy this problem somewhat, if there is indeed some source of more current information that we have yet to find out there. 

## Task Descriptions
![](http://www.visitcalgary.com/sites/default/files/biking-1.jpg)
1. Tom is an 18-year-old college student, who is on his way to Calgary to visit his grandparents for a week. During his stay, Tom rents a bicycle to get around the city for sightseeing and running errands for his family, but would like to avoid the main roads. Tom would like to find out how other bikers get around while avoiding traffic and what popular bike trails are near his location that provide dedicated routes to the city centers while providing scenic routes along the way. 
2. Sally is a 40 year old accountant who got into biking after her son left for college, who doesn’t personally know anyone who is interested in cycling. She has been exploring the city and finding interesting shops and views around her neighborhood, and wants to be able to share about the nice routes with someone that would appreciate them. 

3. Edgar’s computer is currently in the shop, so he decided to dust off his old bike and pump up the tires one weekend. He’s new to the town and doesn’t know the area, but wants to find a nice easy trail near his house that is popular and short enough that he will be back in time for his neighbors barbeque. 

4. Fiona is trying to get fitter for her health, but finds gyms crowded and too much of a chore. She’s working with meal prep to make her weeks dinners with a focus on high protein and low calories, and wants to look into long distance biking to round out her new fitness regime. She wants to be able to plan ahead, and find several trails of increasing difficulty to get her body used to the exertion.

5. Scelene is a 23 year old casual biker who has been appreciating the easy trails in Calgary’s river valley and public parks, but has lately began exploring at the end of the trailheads instead of packing into the car, tacking more and more onto her routes as she visits interesting communities and finds cool architecture and street art. She wants to be able to tell other people who bike the city trails about the cool features that are just beyond the end of the marked trails.

6. Arnold has been running a photo tourism blog for half a year now, and wants to be able to put their reviews of popular trails on a platform that isn’t their rather unnoticed hipster blog, because Arnold thinks that getting their opinion out there is more important than how its delivered. 
 
7. Lincoln is a 28-year-old tourist guide in Calgary. Some of his tours include bike rides around the city with a group of people. As an avid cyclist, Lincoln has discovered a few bike paths that provide shortcuts, as well as beautiful sceneries, which are unbeknown to many of his colleagues. Lincoln would like to find out how he can record this information and how he can share it not only with his colleagues, but also his tour group and others. Lincoln would also like to receive feedback from the users of his trail about their experience.
